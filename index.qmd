# Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to this mini-workshop on brms! The goals of this workshop and reader are to provide a resource for you to learn about:  
  
  - The package's capabilities and utility in a Bayesian workflow
  
  - How brms uses Stan 
  
  - A generalized linear mixed-model example that uses brms

No prerequisites required, however it would be helpful to have an general understanding of Bayesian statistics.
