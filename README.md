Welcome to this mini-workshop on brms! This reader covers the packages basics, how it works under the hood, and an example for how to use the package. 

Goals: 
  
  - Learn about brms capabilities 
  
  - Gain an understanding of how Stan integrates with brms 
  
  - Run a generalized linear mixed-model with the package

No prerequisites required, however it would be helpful to have an general understanding of Bayesian statistics.
