## brms 

brms (short for Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan') is a package
that allows for user friendly specification of Bayesian models. The
package was developed by Paul-Christian BuÌˆrkner. If you are mostly
familiar with linear regression of the frequentist sort, you are in
luck: the formula syntax in brms is *very* similar to that in lme4! The
brms
[README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/readme/README.html)
file links to several resources including extensive package
documentation, vignettes, and forum discussions

If you are new to Bayesian stats or are in need of a little brush up,
check out this [Bayesian
Primer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00001-2) by Van de
Schoot et al. (2021).

## Install brms

Installing brms is pretty straightforward

```{r install}
## Latest release from CRAN
install.packages("brms")

## Or the latest development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("paul-buerkner/brms")
```

## What can it do?

### Model specification

`brm` is the modelling function where you can specify anything that may
be relevant to your model (e.g., the response distribution, priors,
group-level factors, number of chains, iterations, etc.).

Some of the core arguments you will need to specify are:

1.  *formula*: this is where you specify your response and predictor
    variables of interest (e.g., y \~ x). This is also where you will
    specify your random effects (e.g., y \~ x1 + (1\|x2)
2.  *data:* specify your dataframe
3.  *family*: brms can handle a wide range of response distributions
    linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal,
    zero-inflated, self-defined mixture models and much much more! This
    is also where you specify your *link* argument

Other arguments you might want to specify:

1.  *prior*: specify the prior distributions you would like for your
    population-level and group-level variables. You are also not
    restricted to just normal distributions and specify different types
    including uniform, Cauchy, Gamma, etc. If you do not specify your
    priors, the model assumes an uninformed flat prior distribution
    \[double check this\].
2.  *warmup*: number of burn in iterations to help model find stable
    sampling space (default is iter/2)
3.  *iter:* number of total iterations per chain (default is 2000)
4.  *chains*: number of markov chains you would like to run (default is
    4)
5.  *cores*: number of cores to use when chains are running (default is
    1), but you may want to specify more if your computer has
    capability. You can check how many cores you have by using
    parallel::detectCores()
6.  *control:* adjust the sampling behavior of the model. I've mostly
    used this to help lower the number of divergent transitions (e.g.,
    control = list(adapt_delta(x=.9)))
7.  *file:* you can tell the model where to save its results (e.g., file
    = paste0(model,"/m_results")

## How does it work?

## Evaluating the results

Check out your model results: the `summary` function will spit out key
model information like the family, formula, data and number of
observations used in the model, number of samples, WAIC score,
population-level effects and group-level effects (if you have any) with
their respective estimates, error, 95% confidence interval, effective
sample size, and Rhat score.

There are several functions built into `brms` that are useful for
evaluating your model. Most commonly, I will use the following functions
to assess my model:

1.  Leave-one-out cross-validation test on your model with `loo`

2.  Posterior predictive check with the `pp_check`. You can specify
    several different types of checks. The most common ones I use are:
    "dens_overlay" and "intervals_grouped" if I am running a mixed
    model.

3.  Trace plot for your model using `mcmc_plot` a function in the
    `bayesplot` package that is built into the `brms` package

    There are several functions built in to help assess and visualize
    the posterior predictive distribution.

## Other model options in brms

`brm_multiple` for when you have multiple datasets that you would like
to run your model over
