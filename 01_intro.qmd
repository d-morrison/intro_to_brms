## Bayesian stats is much more than just fitting a model

Bayesian statistics require several steps with key decision-making
moments along the way that could greatly impact your analysis. Gelman et
al. (2020) outlines a workflow that helps navigate through the critical
decision points:

1.  Pick an initial model

2.  Fit the model

3.  Validate computation

4.  Address computational issues

5.  Evaluate and use model OR modify the model

6.  Compare models

This workshop covers how aspects of the `brms` package can be applied in
each step of the Bayesian workflow. This is by no means a comprehensive
list of things you should consider in your workflow, but more like a
starter pack. Check out the References section of this reader for
resources with a more comprehensive look at Bayesian statistics.
