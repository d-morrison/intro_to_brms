We are going to work with Allison Horst's penguins dataset. Check out Allison's GitHub for more information: <https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins>.

## Load in data

```{r data upload}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

# Let's load in the "penguins" dataset
d <- penguins
```

The dataset contains observations from 344 penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica, and the dataset consists of the following information:

-   **species**: penguin species (Chinstrap, AdÃ©lie, or Gentoo)

-   **culmen_length_mm**: culmen length (mm)

-   **culmen_depth_mm**: culmen depth (mm)

-   **flipper_length_mm**: flipper length (mm)

-   **body_mass_g**: body mass (g)

-   **island**: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)

-   **sex**: penguin sex

## Setting up the model 

Say we are interested in seeing if there is a correlation between flipper length and body mass, and if this correlation that differs between species and islands.

```{r}

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
